This MATLAB project provides an interactive GUI for learning and experimenting with signal modulation. It supports AM, FM, and PM modulation on various input signals, allowing the user to set parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and phase. The tool also performs sampling, filtering, and reconstruction to demonstrate each stage of the communication process, with real-time waveform visualization for every step. Designed for students and enthusiasts, the GUI offers an intuitive way to understand modulation concepts and observe how signals transform from input to final modulated output.
